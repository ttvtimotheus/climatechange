# Climate Change Visualization 🌍

An interactive web application for visualizing and simulating climate change impacts. The app enables users to explore various climate scenarios and understand their effects on the environment, economy, and society.

## Features 🚀

### 1. Interactive Map
- Visualization of climate risks in different regions
- Flood zone simulation
- City-specific climate data and risk assessments

### 2. Greenhouse Effect Analysis
- Dynamic calculation of 20-year moving averages
- Temperature and CO₂ development comparison
- Adjustable time windows for trend analysis

### 3. Economic Impact
- GDP impact forecasts
- Population affected metrics
- Agricultural loss projections
- Water scarcity indicators

### 4. Energy Mix Simulator
- Detailed control of various energy sources:
  - Solar
  - Wind
  - Hydro
  - Nuclear
  - Fossil fuels
- Real-time CO₂ impact calculations

### 5. Natural Disaster Predictions
- Extreme weather event forecasting
- Regional risk analysis
- Severity and probability calculations
